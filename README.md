## Lighthouse

 was tested using the [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) dev tool program to test the pages for:
* Performance - How the pages run whilst loading.
* Accessibility - Checking how the site is accessible for users.
* Best Practices - Making sure the site fits with industry best practices.
* Seo - Search engine optimisation. Does the site run well with search engine results?

As an example, the results for the Home Page are as follows:

## Deployment

### **To deploy the project**
This site was deployed using the Github Pages platform. To deploy a site with Pages one must:
 1. In Github's repository, navigate to the **Settings** tab.
 2. Once in the Settings, move to the **Pages** tab in the left-hand navigation column.
 3. Under the **Branch** selector, select the **main** option and the **root** folder, then click **save**.
 4. The site will automatically deploy and a green complete banner will indicate success.

### **To fork the repository**
 A copy of the page can be done through forking the Github account. This copy can be viewed and changed without modifying the original. To fork the repository one must:
  1. Log in to **GitHub** and locate the [repository](https://github.com/Miles-Cownie/first-milestone-project)
  2. Select the **fork** option in the top right hand corner of the page to create a copy of the repository.
